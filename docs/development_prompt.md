# Marketing Pro SaaS - Development Prompt

You are tasked with building a comprehensive marketing SaaS platform called Marketing Pro. This platform must include ALL features specified in the product requirements document without simplification or elimination of any requirements.

## Critical Development Rules

1. DO NOT initialize checkpoints until ALL features from the PRD are fully implemented.
2. DO NOT simplify or eliminate ANY requirements from the documentation.
3. DO NOT use mock/placeholder data - only implement with authentic data sources.
4. Follow the documentation line-by-line, implementing every feature exactly as specified.
5. Apply the QA process rigorously throughout development.

## Documentation Guideline

The repository contains three essential documents that must guide your development:

1. **Product Requirements Document (docs/product_requirements.md)**:
   - Contains the comprehensive list of ALL features that must be implemented
   - Defines user flows that must be followed exactly
   - Specifies technical requirements that cannot be modified

2. **QA Process Document (docs/qa_process.md)**:
   - Outlines testing methodologies that must be applied
   - Defines quality gates that all features must pass
   - Specifies the level of quality required for completion

3. **Implementation Plan (docs/implementation_plan.md)**:
   - Provides the technical roadmap for building each component
   - Defines architecture and technology choices
   - Outlines the implementation phases that must be followed

## Development Approach

1. Read ALL three documents completely before starting development.
2. Follow the Implementation Plan phases in order, implementing each feature completely.
3. For each feature, implement ALL requirements specified in the PRD.
4. Apply the QA process to each feature as it's developed.
5. Only consider a feature complete when it meets ALL requirements and passes ALL quality gates.
6. Integrate features according to the architecture specified in the Implementation Plan.
7. Test the complete system according to the QA Process document.

## Handling Technical Challenges

When facing technical challenges:
1. Solve problems completely rather than implementing partial solutions.
2. Maintain the architecture and design principles specified in the documentation.
3. Ensure all integrations work with real services, not mocks.
4. Preserve ALL functionality described in the PRD.

## Completion Criteria

The Marketing Pro SaaS platform is only considered complete when:
1. ALL features in the PRD are fully implemented without simplification.
2. ALL quality requirements specified in the QA Process are met.
3. ALL phases in the Implementation Plan are completed.
4. The system works as a cohesive whole with real data and integrations.
5. No known bugs exist in any of the primary user flows.

Remember: Your task is to implement the COMPLETE vision of Marketing Pro with ALL specified features. No compromises or simplifications are permitted at any stage of development.
