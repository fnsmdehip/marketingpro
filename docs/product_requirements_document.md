## Data Model

### Entity Relationship Diagram
The core data model includes:

- **Users:**
  - ID (primary key)
  - Username (unique)
  - Password (hashed)
  - Optional additional fields as required

Additional entities will be added as needed for specific functionality.

### Schema Definition
The database schema is defined using Drizzle ORM and TypeScript:

```typescript
// Current schema from shared/schema.ts
export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  username: text("username").notNull().unique(),
  password: text("password").notNull(),
});

export const insertUserSchema = createInsertSchema(users).pick({
  username: true,
  password: true,
});

export type InsertUser = z.infer<typeof insertUserSchema>;
export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect;
