- Staging database with anonymized data
- Simulated load conditions

### Production Environment
- Final verification of critical paths
- Monitoring systems active
- Database backup procedures in place

## Test Data Management

- Use of test accounts for social media platforms
- Synthetic data generation for analytics testing
- Test subscription plans with Stripe test mode
- Mock AI responses for consistent testing

## Bug Tracking and Resolution Process

1. **Bug Identification**
   - Detailed bug report including steps to reproduce
   - Severity classification
   - Environment information

2. **Bug Prioritization**
   - Critical: Blocking functionality, security issues
   - High: Major feature issues, poor performance
   - Medium: Non-critical functionality issues
   - Low: UI/UX enhancements, minor improvements

3. **Bug Assignment and Resolution**
   - Assignment to appropriate developer
   - Development and code review
   - Fix verification in development environment

4. **Regression Testing**
   - Verify fix doesn't break other functionality
   - Retest related features

5. **Closure**
   - Documentation of resolution
   - Version tracking for fixed issues

## Release Criteria

### Exit Criteria for Testing
- All critical and high-priority bugs resolved
- 95% of test cases passing
- Performance benchmarks met

- Compatibility verified across target platforms

### Release Approval Process
1. QA sign-off on test completion
2. Product owner review of remaining issues
3. Technical lead approval for deployment
4. Final stakeholder review
5. Release authorization

## Continuous Testing Strategy
