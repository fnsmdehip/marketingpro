# Marketing Pro SaaS - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Marketing Pro SaaS platform. It provides a structured approach to development, including timelines, dependencies, and technical considerations.

## Important Implementation Rule

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT initialize checkpoints until ALL features from the PRD and implementation steps from this plan are fully completed. Each implementation phase must be executed according to specifications without simplification or elimination of any requirements.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context API for UI state
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **Component Library**: ShadCN UI
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight routing

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **API**: RESTful endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with secure cookies
- **Session Management**: Express session with PostgreSQL store
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API integration

### DevOps
- **Hosting**: Replit
- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Application logs and error tracking

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React UI components, pages and layouts
2. **Application Layer**: React hooks, form handling, and client-side validation
3. **API Layer**: REST endpoints for data access
4. **Service Layer**: Business logic, integrations, and third-party connections
5. **Data Layer**: Database access with Drizzle ORM
