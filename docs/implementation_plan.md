# Marketing Pro SaaS - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Marketing Pro SaaS platform. It provides a structured approach to development, including timelines, dependencies, and technical considerations. All implementation must follow the hyper-rational development approach defined in the Programming Context document.

## Important Implementation Rule

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT initialize checkpoints until ALL features from the PRD and implementation steps from this plan are fully completed. Each implementation phase must be executed according to specifications without simplification or elimination of any requirements. All code must adhere to the principles in the Programming Context document.
